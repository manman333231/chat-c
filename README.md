Chatting app written in c to learn stuff. 
To compile just type make all and to remove type make clean. 
Usage for client (first run ./client ofc) is:
m receiver content (for messaging),
b content (for broadcasting),
l (for list),
h (for help).
You must run ./server before running ./client code! Also fill in your server ip and port in the common_macros.h file!
